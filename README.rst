nncli is a Python application that gives you access to your NextCloud
Notes account via the command line. It's a "hard" fork of
sncli_. You can access your notes via
a customizable console GUI that implements vi-like keybinds or via a
simple command line interface that you can script.

Notes can be viewed/created/edited in *both an* **online** *and*
**offline** *mode*. All changes are saved to a local cache on disk and
automatically sync'ed when nncli is brought online.

More detailed documentation can be found at the homepage_.

Contributing
------------

Pull requests are welcome, preferably via emailed output of ``git

Releases
--------

Release tags will always be signed with the maintainer's `PGP key`_
(also available on any public keyserver_).  PGP-signed versions of
release tarballs and pre-built wheel_ packages are available on PyPI_,
with the signature files living alongside the corresponding artifact
(simply append an ``.asc`` extension). Because the maintainers of PyPI
do not consider PGP signatures to be a user-facing feature, the
extension must be added manually in your browser's URL bar in order to
download the signature files.
