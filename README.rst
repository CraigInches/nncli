nncli is a Python application that gives you access to your NextCloud
Notes account via the command line. It's a "hard" fork of
sncli_. You can access your notes via
a customizable console GUI that implements vi-like keybinds or via a
simple command line interface that you can script.

Notes can be viewed/created/edited in *both an* **online** *and*
**offline** *mode*. All changes are saved to a local cache on disk and
automatically sync'ed when nncli is brought online.

More detailed documentation can be found in the docs.
